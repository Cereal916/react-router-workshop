[Open in CodeSandbox 📤](https://bit.ly/2AZBAjV)

#### LEARNING GOALS 🥅

- [ ] Learn about how to add URL parameters.
- [ ] Learn about the `match` object.

### Instructions

1. Add a new `Route` to catch the `/jams/<unique-id>`.
2. Build out the `Vote` component to be rendered at `/jams/<unique-id>`.
3. Use the `getIdea` and `handleVote` API methods to render the idea's `likes` and `title` data, and add the `button` click behavior, respectively.
4. Add a conditional to handle ideas `id`'s that are not in our backend.
