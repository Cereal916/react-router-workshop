#### LEARNING GOALS 🥅

- [ ] Learn about the `NavLink` component.

### Instructions

1. Add `activeStyle` to the navigation links so that when clicked the styling of the link changes accordingly.
2. Add emojis next to the like number depending on the like count. _For example, if the like count is less than 0 we display a 💩, equal to zero - ⭐️, and greater than zero - 🌶._
